    <h1>Tim Is Quite Gay :3</h1>
        <h3>(A personal website by Tim Nolan)</h3>

        So, I'm Tim (<b>the guy from the title!</b>), and this is my <b><i> first website!</i></b> <br>
        I am a 16 year-old highschooler from Ontario, Canada. I really enjoy:
        <ul>
            <li>Programming (especially game development)</li>
            <li>CAD (I'm the CAD lead on the <a href="https://www.4917.ca/" target="_blank">4917 frc team</a>)</li>
            <li>Art and animation (both 2D <i>and</i> 3D :3)</li>
        </ul>

        I am also an active member of <a href="https://hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Hack Club</a>, ever since the summer of 2025 :) <br>
        <br>
